              <h3>Hall of Fame</h3>
              <p>
                One of the main reasons why we started Best Electronics 34+
                years ago, we saw a need for a company to supply Atari end users
                and even Atari Dealers with much needed Atari replacement parts.
                Atari USA would not bring in certain Atari replacement parts to
                fix product problems and no other companies that sold or
                supported Atari products wanted to tackle this issue. So Best
                Electronics found it's niche in the Atari world back then.
