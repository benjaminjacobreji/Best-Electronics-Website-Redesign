<strong style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Heat up the old Atari Portfolio inner see

enough to start to distort the old cover / window), the from one of the four 
corners, start peal off old damaged / scratched Portfolio display window and 
just peal off the old window left to right or right to left.&nbsp; </strong>
<strong><font color="#0000FF">Interesting Atari Portfolio tech tip:&nbsp; </font>
</strong></font><strong style="font-weight: 400"><font size="4" face="Arial">
Once you remove the old damaged / scratched up Portfolio display window / cover, 
look over to the left side / corner where the old Portfolio widow was applied to 
the inner Portfolio gray bezel.&nbsp; You will see two small screws (on some 
early generation Atari Portfolio inner display gray plastic bezels you will only 
see the black Philips case screw).&nbsp; A black Phillips case screw and a 
second shinny metal slotted head screw.&nbsp; This shinny metal slotted screw 
head is the Portfolio LCD contrast adjustment screw.&nbsp; Using a small slotted 
screwdriver, you adjust the contrast LCD display setting to a darker or lighter 
LCD display / letters.&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial Black" size="4"><u>I</u></font></strong><font face="Arial Black" size="4"><u><strong style="font-weight: 400">t 
is strongly advised</strong></u></font><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong style="font-weight: 400">, 
you made a one time display contrast setting change on your Portfolio.&nbsp; 
Because once you apply the new replacement Portfolio window, trying to repeal 
off the new Portfolio window a second time usually puts a memory in the bent up 
left corner side of the new display window which will always never seem to sit 
flat the second time you try to flatten it.&nbsp; Like when your Atari Portfolio 
was brand new, the New replacement OEM Portfolio clear Window / display cover 
comes with a clear protective top cover which you remove or leave on your new 
Atari Portfolio window as an extra protective cover.&nbsp; </strong><strong>

Portfolio&#146;s total Memory to 640K and allows a 592K Memory RAM Disk. Installing or
removing a Portfolio 256K Memory Expander into or out of your Portfolio requires a
Complete Cold Boot of the Portfolio. So always back up all Data Portfolio&#146;s Memory
information before installing or removing the 256K Memory Expander. Since the 256KMemory
Expander re-quires no external power and gets its power to maintain the memory from the
Portfolio itself, this Expander should Never be removed from the Portfolio or installed
into the Portfolio with data in the Portfolio Memory or Expander Memory, in both cases it
will require a Cold Boot (Erases the contents of the Portfolio&#146;s Memory-both RAM and
Drive C) of the Portfolio before it will work again. In other words once the 256K memory
Expander is installed and the Portfolio is configured to recognize the extra memory it is
best to leave it installed or do a Complete Cold reboot of your Portfolio every time you
install the 256K Memory Expander.</font><font size="4">&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial"><font size="4">HPC-104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $179.00&nbsp;</font><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ram Card Tech Tip:&nbsp; </span></font><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF"><b>Remember that all Atari made 
Portfolio Ram Cards (32K, 64K and 128K) have an internal very thin lithium 
CR2016 coin battery (they can be accessed / removed on one end of Portfolio Ram 
Card that hangs outside of the Portfolio case, the internal small crescent 
shaped black plastic coin battery holder, sometimes have a very very small 
sliding locking tab on the end of the Portfolio ram card edge to lock the 
battery holder into the ram card) to keep voltage on the Portfolio Ram chips 
when the card is not inserted into the Atari Portfolio PDA.&nbsp;&nbsp; These 
lithium coin batteries are have a fixed life cycle (typical 1 to 3+ years of use 
/ Portfolio Ram storage time, depending if the Portfolio ram card is left in a 
running / power up Portfolio all of them time or stored outside of the 
Portfolio) when used in an Atari Portfolio Ram Card. </b></font>

up device will supply 
voltage to the inserted Portfolio Ram card, to keep the Portfolio ram chips 
voltage up, while you changing out the old dying 2016 battery.&nbsp; </font></b></span><b>

voltage (with a VOM meter) left on the CR2016 Coin battery about 6 months to a 
year later after you have changed out Portfolio Ram card batteries.&nbsp; This 
will give you a rough idea when you should do the next Portfolio Ram Card new 
battery swap out.&nbsp; You should not let your Portfolio Ram Card batteries 
drop below 2.50 volts, below this amount of volts you will start to loose memory 
storage / data on your stored Atari Portfolio Ram cards. <font color="#008000">&nbsp;</font><font color="#0000FF">Use 
the small Portfolio labels that are provided with each new Atari Portfolio Ram 
Card to mark the date you installed a new CR2016 Colin battery and the next date 
when a new fresh CR2016 Coin battery should be installed in your Portfolio Ram 
Card and apply this small label to the Portfolio Ram Card.</font></span></font></b></font></p>

T<font size="4">his Upgrade Manual was written in
Germany by Stefan Kachele and translated into English by W. Holl. This upgrade manual has
three Different hardware upgrades for the Atari Portfolio! 1. Three different Internal
memory upgrades (With schematics) 224K, 320K or 512K of Internal Ram. 2. Increasing the
Clock speed of the Portfolio from 4.9MHz to 6.5MHz, up to 33% faster performance. 3.
Increasing the low battery warning time from 10 -15 minutes to change the batteries to 48+
hours before the batteries are drained and the data is lost. It may be necessary to
install a second internal reset switch if you require a complete Portfolio cold reboot in
the future once this Upgrade is done. 4. Using the Portfolio parallel port with PBASIC as
an I/O Interface. These upgrades should only be attempted by an Experienced Electronic
Technician with a good background in SMT type practical experience!!</font></font>
