# Best Electronics Website Redesign

**Original Website:** [Atari - Best Electronics Home](http://best-electronics-ca.com/)

A static version of the redesigned website is availiable at [Best Electronics | Welcome](https://benjaminjacobreji.github.io/Best-Electronics-Website-Redesign/).

**Note:** **The static version is to demo the UI of the redesign.** The STORE page in the link above will download a php file rather than display the appropriate webpage, since the website is statically hosted via GitHub Pages and does not have access to PHP and MySQL.
